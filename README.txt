At the beginning i created this program to be a resistor calculator to help electronic technicians, 
students and engineers, where the user can inform the colors of the resistor he has on hands and 
find out which value (Ohms) the component has or he can inform the value (Ohms) and get the related 
colors of that resistor. 

Later i decided to add new functionalities, with new tabs to support a capacitor calculator, 
where the user can find out the capacitor code from its value or the value from its code, and 
to allow the user to organize his electronic project, making a list of components and being 
able to print, share etc.
